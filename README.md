# CovidTestForm
This project demonstrates my approach to implement a software solution for covid test centres. 
I wrote this while I was in college to help out a friend who in that time ran a covid test centre.
This version of the source code does not reflect the entire project. I've removed some files and parts of the source code because this project was used in production. Therefore, some private information regarding my client was embedded within some html files or the result pdf pages.

### This code may serve as a reference for employers by demonstrating the following skills among others:
- competence in writing java code
- understanding of basic concepts of the spring framework
- recognition of MCV concepts
- Basic JPA knowledge
- ability to create and run a java environment inside a docker container
- manual SSL encryption (wouldn't do it this way now... the more you learn)
- E-mail stuff like DKIM-keys or SPF-records etc. (By the way, i found Simple Java Mail to be an excellent library or sending mails )

### Functionality includes among others:
- Frontend for Test subjects to register
- Admin Panel to handel test result notifications
- Automatic notifications via email
- Generation of covid test certificates in pdf format
- Some basic JUnit Test Cases

Thanks a ton for taking a look :)
